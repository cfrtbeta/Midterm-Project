# Midterm-Project  


Hello, My name is Alexander Hutson and this is my midterm project for infotech 1000. I have learned a lot about coding and how computers work over the last few weeks. I am also taking infotech 1040, so I am really getting my fill of coding experience. While you read through this project, you will learn a bit about who I am, and what I've done with my life so far. I think that it's pretty cool (but I might be a little biased).
