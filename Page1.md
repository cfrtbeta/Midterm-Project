# A Short Story About My Life 
[Go back to Homepage](README.md)  
  
  ## Origins
  I was born in Springfield, MO to Jessica and Christian Hutson. I lived there for the entirety of my [childhood](/IMG_0643.PNG). My parents are entrepreneurs and they own a cigar shop called [_**Just For Him**_](https://www.justforhim.com). I met some of the most interesting people in the world there, and each of our customers acted as another father to me.  
## University  
I did fairly well on my standardized tests, but had _eh_ grades. I completely freaked out and ended up applying to Mizzou. There I began work with the Residence Halls Association. I have been the President of it for the last three years. It has been the single best professional development learning that I've had the opportunity to participate in. 
## Camp  
I also have worked at [Cub Creek Science Camp](https://www.bearriverranch.com). It is my home away from home, and the most fun I've had in my life. I met my current girlfriend there who runs the **Zoo** that is on site. It's the coolest thing on earth for the campers that get to come there.
